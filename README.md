🎮 Game Overview
Crown & Coin: A Kingdom's Economy

You are the Ruler-Economist of a kingdom.

You have 10 days to maximize your kingdom’s economic health.

Each day, 3 characters (nobles, merchants, peasants, bankers) visit with proposals or dilemmas.

You decide whether to say yes or no, and your decision affects:

🪙 GDP

📉 CPI (inflation)

👷 Unemployment

⚖️ Inequality

<!-- 📊 Public Opinion -->


📊 Economics Core Stats
You track the following:
| Stat             | Description                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GDP              | Overall output; influenced by investment, consumption, and government spending.             |
| CPI / Inflation  | Tracks inflation; too high = instability, too low = stagnation.                             |
| Unemployment     | Shows how many people are jobless.                                                          |
| Inequality       | Rises with policies that favor the wealthy, lowers with redistribution.                     |
| Money Multiplier | Based on MPS (Marginal Propensity to Save); affects money supply from central bank actions. |
<!-- | Public Opinion | Optional: if this drops too low, you risk rebellion or unrest.                              | -->

🏛️ Actions You Can Take
You act as both the government and central bank, so you can:

Raise/Lower Taxes

Change Government Spending

Buy/Sell Bonds (open market ops)

Change Interest Rates

Implement Policies (e.g., wealth tax, subsidies, UBI, austerity, tariffs)

🧠 Prompt System Example
🧝‍♂️ "The Elvish Bankers ask you to cut interest rates to boost lending. It could boost investment, but inflation may rise."

✔️ Approve: Investment rises, but CPI may go up

❌ Deny: No change, but bankers disapprove

👷 "A workers' union asks for increased public spending to create jobs."

✔️ Approve: Unemployment drops, but deficit increases

❌ Deny: Inequality rises, unemployment unchanged


🧮 Basic Economic Model (Behind the Scenes)

GDP = C + I + G (in our isolated country, there is no foreign exchange)

Money Multiplier = 1 / MPS

Inflation increases if GDP growth > productivity growth

Unemployment drops if investment or G rises

Inequality rises when tax cuts for rich or spending cuts


Possible endings:

⭐ Booming Paradise

💀 Stagflation Nightmare

🔥 Social Uprising

⚖️ Balanced Growth
